# EECS6699: Math for Deep Learning Project 

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of SqueezeNet for the EECS6699 course project, focusing on Math for Deep Learning. SqueezeNet is a lightweight deep neural network architecture designed for efficient inference on embedded devices and low-power platforms. This project aims to explore the mathematical foundations and concepts behind SqueezeNet's architecture and performance.

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Apurva3509/SqueezeNet_HAD.git

## SqueezeNet Implementation
This project utilizes the implementation of SqueezeNet provided by PyTorch's torchvision library. You can find the implementation [here](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/squeezenet.py).

## Base Paper
For a detailed understanding of SqueezeNet's architecture and design principles, refer to the base paper titled "SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and < 0.5 MB model size" by Iandola et al. The paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.07360.pdf).

## Additional Implementations
For alternative implementations and variations of SqueezeNet, you can explore the repository [here](https://github.com/forresti/SqueezeNet/tree/master).

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to submit bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve the project.
